# JFreeze

__Developed by – Shouvik Mitra and Naseem Ali__

## Description: ##
This Java application freezes your screen preventing any action through input devices like keyboard or mouse. 

## How it works: ##
1.	Program Starts
2.	Calculate screen attributes like height and width of the screen
3.	Creates a frame having above attributes so that it covers the entire screen
4.	Change colour of frame to transparent
5.	Prevents key input and mouse clicks is automatically blocked due to frame always on top property
6.	Remains on top of the screen freezing it until destruct key is pressed (to get the destruct key you have to read the code : smile :)

## Developments required: ##
1.	Run the entire process as a thread so that the app does not appear in taskbar.
2.	Start at event selection
3.	Update documentation


## Potential Use Cases:##
•	Preventing PIRACY in your application (view only mode)
•	eTesting Plaform – to stop taking user response after time up
•	and a lot more...
